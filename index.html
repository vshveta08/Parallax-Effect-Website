    <!-- parallax effect -> movement of 2 objects is different for another object(3rd) because of distance.
                         -> eg. we are in car & going on road, so we can see movement of buildings will be fast compare to movement of sun because
                                sun has on more distance to us comapre to buildings.
        So in this I will generate this type of effect.

                <p>There is a very famous quote by Hellen Keller, “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.” An adventure is something challenging, that takes us out of our ordinary lives and forces us to try new things. The definition of adventure varies from person to person. It can best be described as, “The risky undertaking of an unknown outcome, the result of which may also be dangerous or in favour.”</p>
                <br>
                <p>There is a huge impact of adventures on a person’s life. Some of these impacts are mentioned below:
                    <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The excitement and happiness during an adventure release hormones in our body which are helpful for our mental health.</li>
                        <li>Trying new things and exploring new places for adventure helps in expanding our knowledge.</li>
                        <li>It helps in discovering one’s abilities and strengths.</li>
                        <li>It makes daily life richer.</li>

                In many countries, the most commonly used vehicle for road transport is a utility bicycle. These have frames with relaxed geometry, protecting the rider from shocks of the road and easing steering at low speeds. Utility bicycles tend to be equipped with accessories such as mudguards, pannier racks and lights, which extends their usefulness on a daily basis. Since the bicycle is so effective as a means of transportation, various companies have developed methods of carrying anything from the weekly shop to children on bicycles.
                It takes a lot of endurance, patience, stamina and courage to pass through the unique geography of India. With every paddle, you will get an opportunity to explore a different world.

            <div class="content">
               <p> India is a land of infinite possibilities. And by infinite I literally mean infinite! There are some ways in which you can be flying like a bird like soaring away in a hot air balloon or parasailing, in which you are tied at the rear end of a boat using a rope or something, and then there is the ultimate feeling-like-a-bird sport which is paragliding. Paragliding may well be referred to as the ultimate bird-like feeling. As a basic overview, the pilot is supposed to sit in a harness which is suspended from a wing-like structure and then you have just got to run off a cliff and viola! You are up in the air like an actual bird. Interesting much?! Or thinking that it is for the mad adrenaline junkies or the suicidal maniacs. To tell the truth, it is none of those things. People now are becoming aware of the fact that the rides are pretty safe and that there are other fail-safe options. If you manage to follow the rules and regulations of paragliding, then there are absolutely no chances of failing.

            </div>
            <p class="content">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
                <br><br>
                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
